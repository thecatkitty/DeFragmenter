Matriksoft DeFragmenter
=======================

The name of this project was very misleading. It is not a defrgmentation utility. This program was meant to provide a way of putting together a file consisting of many fragments available locally, or over HTTP or FTP. It was supposed to locate them using a description file. This program has never been used.

This project has been pushed to GitHub for archival reasons.
